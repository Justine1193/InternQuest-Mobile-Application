1. Introduction

- Welcome to InternQuest — an app to connect student interns and employers, manage internship requirements, and share documents ("Service"). These terms ("Agreement") govern your use of the Service. By creating an account or using the Service you accept these terms.

2. Accounts & Access

- You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your account and password.
- You agree to provide accurate, complete information when creating or updating your account.
- You are responsible for all activity conducted through your account.

3. User Content & Uploads

- The Service allows uploading documents and files (e.g., PDF, image). You retain ownership of files you upload.
- By uploading content you grant InternQuest a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store, process, display, reproduce and distribute that content for the purposes of providing and improving the Service (including admin review and staff downloads).

4. Firestore vs Storage & Admin Access

- Small uploaded files may be stored as base64 in Firestore for quick admin preview. Larger files will be stored in Firebase Storage and admin records contain download URLs.

5. Privacy & Data use

- We collect user-provided data (profile, uploaded documents) and usage data required to deliver the Service.
- Uploaded files and metadata may be stored in Firestore or Storage and may be accessible to authorized administrators and reviewers.
- For details about data handling and your rights, see our Privacy Policy.

6. Acceptable Use

- Do not use the Service for unlawful activities, spam, abusive content, or to infringe others’ rights.
- We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations.

7. Security & Backups

- We apply reasonable security measures but cannot guarantee absolute safety of data. You should keep backups of important files.

8. Changes

- We may update this Agreement — a notice will be posted or sent. Continued use after updates means acceptance.
