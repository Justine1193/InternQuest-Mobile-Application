# Security Documentation

## 🔒 Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the InternQuest mobile application.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Firebase Authentication with email/password
- ✅ Role-based access control (User/Admin)
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Password reset functionality

### Data Protection
- ✅ Firebase Security Rules for Firestore
- ✅ Firebase Storage Rules for file uploads
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety

### Input Validation
- ✅ Email validation (restricted to @neu.edu.ph)
- ✅ Student ID format validation (XX-XXXXX-XXX)
- ✅ Phone number validation (11 digits)
- ✅ Strong password requirements

## 🚨 Critical Security Measures

### 1. Firebase Security Rules
**File**: `firebase/firestore.rules`
- Users can only access their own data
- Companies collection: read for authenticated users, write for admins only
- Weekly reports: users can only access their own reports
- Default deny all access

### 2. Storage Security Rules
**File**: `firebase/storage.rules`
- Users can only upload to their own folder
- Company logos: read for authenticated users, upload for admins only
- Default deny all access

### 3. Input Sanitization
**File**: `services/security.ts`
- HTML tag removal
- Input trimming
- Format validation

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### API Keys
- Firebase config keys are visible in client-side code
- Consider using environment variables for production
- Implement certificate pinning for additional security

### Data Privacy
- User data is stored in Firebase Firestore
- Personal information is protected by security rules
- Regular security audits recommended

### Mobile Security
- No root/jailbreak detection implemented
- Consider implementing app integrity checks
- Implement certificate pinning for API calls

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always validate and sanitize user input
2. Use Firebase Security Rules for data access control
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Regular security updates and audits
5. Follow OWASP mobile security guidelines

### For Users
1. Use strong, unique passwords
2. Enable two-factor authentication if available
3. Keep the app updated
4. Report suspicious activity immediately

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Security Breach Protocol
1. Immediately disable affected accounts
2. Review Firebase logs for unauthorized access
3. Update security rules if necessary
4. Notify affected users
5. Document the incident and lessons learned
