# Deploy to Netlify - Step by Step Guide

## Your React App is Ready for Deployment! ðŸš€

Your project has been successfully built and is ready to deploy to Netlify. Here are the different ways to deploy:

### Method 1: Manual Deployment (Easiest)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop the `dist` folder from your project to the deployment area
4. Your site will be live in seconds!

### Method 2: Git Deployment (Recommended for ongoing development)
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Go to Netlify dashboard
3. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
4. Connect your Git provider and select your repository
5. Set build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Method 3: Using Netlify CLI (Alternative)
If the CLI works on your system:
```bash
netlify deploy --create-site "internquest-app" --dir dist --prod
```

## Important Notes:
- âœ… Your app is already built in the `dist` folder
- âœ… `netlify.toml` configuration file is created
- âœ… React Router will work properly with the redirects configured
- âœ… Your Firebase configuration will work on the deployed site

## After Deployment:
- Netlify will give you a random URL (like `https://amazing-app-123456.netlify.app`)
- You can customize the domain in Netlify settings
- Every time you push to your Git repository, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy

## Troubleshooting:
- If you get build errors, check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Make sure your Firebase configuration allows your Netlify domain
- The `netlify.toml` file handles React Router redirects automatically

Your InternQuest Mobile Application is ready to go live! ðŸŽ‰
